# my-first-project
This's my first project on the github.

The content is from @zjusbo.It's a Movie Recommending System project, a homework of the Machine Learning course in Yale University.

The following is his words:

"Utilize collabrative filtering algorithm to recommend movies to users.

Some codes are refactorized from the material of Machine Learning course on Coursera.
